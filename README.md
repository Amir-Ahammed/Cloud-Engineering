# Cloud-Engineering
This repository documents my continuous learning journey toward becoming a **Cloud Engineer and Cloud Security Engineer**, focusing on building, automating, and securing scalable cloud environments.

My primary focus is on **AWS Cloud**, with extended exploration into **Azure, Terraform, Kubernetes, and DevSecOps practices**. This repo serves as a structured collection of study notes, hands-on labs, certifications, and automation scripts â€” reflecting both foundational knowledge and real-world implementation skills.
