# Cloud-Engineering
This repository documents my continuous learning journey toward becoming a **Cloud Engineer and Cloud Security Engineer**, focusing on building, automating, and securing scalable cloud environments.
<br>
My primary focus is on **AWS Cloud**, with extended exploration into **Azure, Terraform, Kubernetes, and DevSecOps practices**. This repo serves as a structured collection of study notes, hands-on labs, certifications, and automation scripts — reflecting both foundational knowledge and real-world implementation skills.

# Objectives
- Master AWS core and advanced services for compute, networking, storage, and IAM
- Design and deploy secure, automated, and scalable cloud infrastructure
- Learn Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using **Terraform** and configuration management with **Ansible**
- Build containerized environments using **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- Strengthen cloud security through IAM best practices, encryption, monitoring, and compliance frameworks
- Gain cross-cloud exposure to Azure and GCP for hybrid and multi-cloud understanding
